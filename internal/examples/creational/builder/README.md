# Builder

## Description

Instance creation can be as simple as providing the opening and closing braces {} and leaving the instance with default values, or at least as minimum as possible.

At the same time, you might be using the same technique to create many types of objects. This is where the builder pattern can help us to reuse the construction process.


## Usage
 - When you have reusable technique when initiating some objects, i.e. you have to create multiple user objects with different type, the steps are similar set the user level, and set type of the user. 
 - Etc
