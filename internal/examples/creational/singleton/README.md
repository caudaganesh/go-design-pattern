# Singleton

## Description

Singleton pattern, as it sounds, is pattern that make sure that we create only single instance of an object, and guarantee that there are no duplicates. At the beginning of getting the instance, it will create the instance, but later it will return the single instance of the object. 

## Usage
 - When you want to use same connection to access the db
 - When you have limited resources, such as RAM. 
 - Etc
